# Shapeshifter: a tiny standalone Python JSON/CSV data converter

Are you sitting between developers using JSON APIs and business analysts using Excels and CSVs? Does your job require a lot of tedious data conversion from/to JSON and CSV? Do you have to deal with JSON APIs that regurgitate half of the database on every endpoint, regardless of what you actually need?

If the answer was yes, look no further than here. This library lets you convert JSON -> CSV or CSV -> JSON in one terminal command, or it can be embedded into another Python script as a dependency.

Now, what are you looking for?

## I want a quick command line script to do the work for me
